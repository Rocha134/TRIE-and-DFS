# TRIE-and-DFS
TRIE DATA STRUCTURE WITH INSERTION, SEARCH AND DFS

Write a C++ program that implements a TRIE data structure.
Also write a program that allows you to verify its functionality.
The input to the program is a number N , followed by N words, which will be inserted into the structure
Then a data M is read followed by M words to search for in the structure

The output of the program is the DFS traversal of the TRIE, followed by M booleans corresponding to the result of searching each of the M words in the structure.

 

Your program should be called main.cpp and should compile using the g++ command in a linux environment.

 

Your program must be able to run using redirected input in a linux environment
